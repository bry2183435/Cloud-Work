# EC2 - Raw Archives & Materials

This branch contains the full, unfiltered record of my AWS EC2 learning journey. Here you’ll find everything — quizzes, hands-on labs, notes, corrections, and my thought process at every step. Nothing has been cut or condensed. 

**Purpose of this branch:**
- Personal tracking of progress, weak points, and improvements.
- Complete documentation of trial-and-error, including mistakes and refinements.
- Reference for myself to revisit concepts and labs in detail.

**Note for viewers:**
This branch is primarily for my own study, but I’m happy to share it with anyone interested in seeing the full process. Feedback or tips are welcome, as they help me refine my skills and approach.  

**Tip:** For a concise, polished version of my work, see the `Professional Archives` branch.
