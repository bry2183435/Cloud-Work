# EC2 - Professional Archives

This branch contains a curated record of my AWS EC2 progress, including quizzes and hands-on labs. Its purpose is to demonstrate not just knowledge, but practical skills and consistent effort. 

**Key points:**
- Concise and clear documentation for quick review.
- Includes refined answers to quizzes and lab exercises.
- Shows my workflow and understanding of EC2 concepts and tasks.
- Designed to give confidence that I can execute cloud tasks reliably.

If you’re interested in seeing the full process — including all the raw, unfiltered work, mistakes, and thought processes — feel free to check out the `Raw Archives & Materials` branch. That branch is my personal study and tracking space, but I’m happy to share it with anyone who wants to dig deeper, provide feedback, or offer tips I may have missed.
