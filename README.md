üå©Ô∏è Cloud Projects Showcase

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Security Architecture Showcase.
This repository highlights selected projects where I‚Äôve designed, deployed, and documented real cloud infrastructure on AWS.

My goal: practical, production-minded solutions for small businesses and freelance clients.

üöÄ Featured Projects
1. EC2 Web Server Deployment

Built a secure and scalable PHP web server on Amazon EC2.
Used AWS Systems Manager for access (no SSH keys).
Configured IAM instance profile for AWS SDK usage.
Documented bootstrapping with User Data scripts.

2. VPC with Public & Private Subnets

Designed a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with:
Public + Private Subnets
Internet Gateway + NAT Gateway
Proper routing for secure backend/frontend separation
Demonstrated Shared Responsibility Model and secure architecture.

3. EC2 Auto Scaling & Load Balancing

Implemented Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with multiple routing strategies.
Configured Auto Scaling Group with min/desired/max capacity.
Demonstrated scalability vs. elasticity in practice.

üßë‚Äçüíª Skills Demonstrated

EC2 Instance Management (deployments, pricing models, optimization)
Networking & Security (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, IAM)
Scalability & Reliability (Auto Scaling, Load Balancing)
Cost Optimization (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans)
Professional Documentation (step-by-step labs, architecture diagrams)

üìà Next Steps

I‚Äôm currently expanding into:

Networking & Security Projects (VPC Peering, VPNs, WAF)
Storage Projects (S3, EBS, lifecycle policies, backups)
Automation Projects (CloudFormation, Lambda, EventBridge)

‚ö° Note: My raw learning logs and draft notes are kept in separate branches (raw-archives, professional-archives). This main branch only contains my best, portfolio-ready work.
