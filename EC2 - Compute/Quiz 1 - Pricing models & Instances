ChatGPT said:

Nice job — you’re really locking in a lot of these. Let’s go through them step by step:

✅ Section 1

B — Spot Instances → Correct!

❌ Wrong. (Hint: One gives you control over which physical server, the other just gives you isolation but no server-level control.)

C — Reserved Instances → Correct!

✅ Section 2

❌ Marked wrong (and you admitted to peeking 👀). As punishment, here’s a harder one:

Punishment Q: What is the biggest limitation of EC2 Capacity Reservations compared to Reserved Instances or Savings Plans?

❌ Wrong. Correct answer was D — Amazon RDS (Savings Plans don’t cover it).

✅ Section 3

Console, CLI, SDK → Correct!

B — AWS CLI → Correct!

✅ Section 4

The consumer → Correct!

The consumer → Correct again!

✅ Section 5

B — Compute optimized → Correct!

❌ Wrong. (Hint: Think “RAM-heavy, analytics, in-memory databases.” Which family name signals memory?)

❌ Wrong. Correct answer is B — Storage optimized (for I/O-intensive apps).

✅ Section 6

❌ Not quite. (Hint: Think time and scalability, not just cost. What slows you down with on-premises hardware?)

B — EC2 On-Demand → Correct!

⚡ Scorecard so far:

Correct: 8

Wrong / needs retry: 6 (Q2, Q4 punishment, Q5, Q11, Q12, Q13)

👉 Want me to keep this style (marking wrong + giving you hints/punishment harder Qs) and let you retry the missed ones?

You said:
yes lets go again with the failed ones
ChatGPT said:

Perfect, let’s run back the ones you missed. I’ll keep the hint system in place — no full answers until you crack them.

🔁 Retry Questions

Q2 (Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances)
Hint: Both provide isolation. One gives you server-level control (placement, licensing), while the other just gives you isolation without server choice. Which is which?

Q4 (Punishment Question — Capacity Reservations)
Question: What is the biggest limitation of Capacity Reservations compared to Reserved Instances or Savings Plans?
Hint: Think about cost-efficiency — you’re paying regardless of what?

Q5 (Savings Plans coverage)
Hint: Savings Plans apply across compute services like EC2, Lambda, and Fargate. But they don’t apply to every AWS service. Which database service was the exception?

Q11 (Memory instances)
Hint: The family name literally signals what it’s good at: in-memory analytics, databases, RAM-heavy workloads. Starts with M.

Q12 (Storage optimized)
Hint: Which instance type is literally built for I/O-heavy apps like data warehousing, big transactional DBs? Its name signals storage.

Q13 (On-premises challenges)
Hint: Besides high upfront costs, what other two big pain points slow you down compared to cloud? (Think: waiting and inflexibility.)

👉 Your turn — take another crack at these!

You said:
2) Hosts Provide you with a full control of the server while the instance provides you with isolation 
4) You are paying regardless if the instance is used or not
5)idk twin i am taking an L on that one
11) Memory optimized instances
12) Storage-optimized Instance
13)I give up im wrong here

ChatGPT said:

Solid recovery run 🔥 — you nailed most of the retries. Let’s break it down:

Q2 ✅ Correct!

Dedicated Hosts = full control of physical server.

Dedicated Instances = isolation, but AWS picks the host.

Q4 ✅ Correct!

Limitation: You pay for the reservation whether you use it or not.

Q5 ❌ (You tapped out 😅)

Correct answer: Amazon RDS (Savings Plans don’t apply to it).

Q11 ✅ Correct!

Memory optimized = best for big data, analytics, RAM-heavy workloads.

Q12 ✅ Correct!

Storage optimized = designed for I/O-heavy workloads, large DBs, warehouses.

Q13 ❌ (gave up)

Correct answer:

Time-consuming setup (ordering, delivery, installing hardware).

Inflexibility (locked into a fixed capacity, can’t scale up/down quickly).

⚡ Updated Scorecard:

Total correct after retries: 12/14

Misses: Q5, Q13

🔥 Not bad at all. You’re clearly locking this in.

Do you want me to ramp difficulty next round (scenario-based, mixing multiple concepts in one question), or keep this format (short-answer + multiple choice with hints)?

You said:
I couldnt even get em right the first time okay, strengths weakness. What should I be reading over for the next run and is this a good warm up before I begin my hands on lab work ? 
ChatGPT said:

This is exactly what you’re supposed to feel right now — the first round is always shaky, but the fact that you corrected most on the retry shows you’re absorbing the knowledge. Let’s break this down:

💪 Strengths (what you’re locking in)

Pricing models (On-Demand, Spot, RIs, Savings Plans): You consistently understood the basic purpose of each.

Shared Responsibility Model: You got it right both times (consumer handles in-cloud security).

Ways to interact with AWS: You nailed CLI vs Console vs SDK.

Instance families (general vs compute vs memory): After retry, you were sharp.

⚠️ Weaknesses (where to focus reading)

Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances:
You know it now, but this subtle distinction trips people up. Re-read this section to reinforce.

Capacity Reservations vs Reserved Instances/Savings Plans:
Key point: CR = guaranteed capacity, less cost-efficient.
You got it after the hint, but worth reviewing.

Savings Plans coverage (RDS exception):
This one caught you — skim the "What are Savings Plans?" page in AWS docs to see the scope.

On-premises vs Cloud benefits:
You defaulted to "costs + resources," but the key friction is: time delays and inflexibility. Review this part.

📖 What to read over before next quiz

EC2 Pricing & Reservations: Focus on the differences between On-Demand, RIs, Savings Plans, and Capacity Reservations.

Dedicated Options: Hosts vs Instances — one last reread will lock it in.

On-Prem vs Cloud: Get crystal-clear on why AWS is faster and more flexible.

🔥 Is this a good warm-up before labs?

Yes — 100%.
Here’s why:

Labs are hands-on muscle memory, but if you go in without knowing the concepts, you’ll just be clicking buttons without context.

Doing these quizzes first builds fluency in the language AWS uses, so when you see “Reserved Instance” or “Capacity Reservation” in the console, it won’t feel foreign.

This is the same way AWS cert prep guides are structured: concept → quiz → lab → review. You’re following the right pattern.

👉 My suggestion:

Give yourself one more short quiz round on your weak areas (I’ll tailor it to just those).

Then jump into lab work while the concepts are fresh — it’ll feel smoother and you’ll learn faster.

Want me to build that targeted weakness-only quiz for your next round before lab?

You said:
should I read before we do another round like refresh or no just stay where im at ? 
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👌 — here’s the trade-off:

If you read first (refresh)

✅ You’ll perform better on the next round.

✅ Boosts confidence (you’ll feel “oh yeah, I know this now”).

❌ Risk: you may end up recognizing words instead of actually recalling them from memory. That’s called the illusion of mastery.

If you stay where you’re at and go straight into another quiz

✅ You’ll see what’s really sticking vs. what you still can’t recall cold.

✅ Builds stronger retrieval practice (the most powerful learning tool).

❌ Might feel frustrating because you’ll miss a few again.

👉 My recommendation for you (based on your goal of fluency and confidence):

Don’t reread right now.

Go straight into another weakness-targeted quiz cold.

After that round, then skim the sections you still miss. That way, reading becomes active correction instead of passive review.

Would you like me to cook up that weakness-only quiz (Dedicated vs Instances, Capacity Reservations, Savings Plans coverage, On-prem vs Cloud)?

You said:
lets do it!
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s zero in on the weak spots. This will be short, focused, and challenging, with the same hint system as before.

🔹 Targeted Weakness Quiz

1. Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances (Short Answer)
Hint: One gives you full server control, the other just gives you isolation.

2. Capacity Reservations limitation (Short Answer)
Hint: You pay even if you don’t use it. What’s the trade-off or downside compared to RIs?

3. Savings Plans coverage (Multiple Choice)
Which service is NOT covered by AWS Savings Plans?
A. AWS Lambda
B. Amazon EC2
C. AWS Fargate
D. Amazon RDS

4. On-Premises vs Cloud (Short Answer)
Hint: Beyond cost and resources, what are the two major challenges of on-premises infrastructure compared to cloud?

5. Mixed scenario (Short Answer)
Your company has a predictable, steady workload, but you also want flexibility in instance size and region. Which combination of pricing or reservation is most cost-effective while still giving some flexibility?
(Hint: Think Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances vs Capacity Reservations.)

Take your shot at these! I’ll mark them correct/wrong and give hints where needed — no peeking this time 😉.

You said:
1) Dedicated hosts allow the consumer to decide the server and have full control over it a dedicated instances is simply isolated with nobody else on it to share it! 
2)It's prepaid and the costs are already losts even if you need more space you have to pay a load more to due missed targets
3)D
4) It is inflexable and slow to manage/change large scale upkeep as well
5)I think you would be getting a reserved instance since you know the workload and can spin up if desired but you are not tied down to a certain region or size 
ChatGPT said:

Nice! Let’s go through your answers carefully:

Q1 ✅ Correct

Dedicated Hosts = full control of the physical server.

Dedicated Instances = isolation without choosing the server.

Q2 ❌ Partially correct

You’re on the right track thinking about cost. Key idea: Capacity Reservations are charged at On-Demand rates whether or not you use the reserved capacity.

Hint for next try: Focus on the “pay even if not running” aspect, not on scaling.

Q3 ✅ Correct

Savings Plans don’t cover Amazon RDS.

Q4 ✅ Correct

Challenges: Inflexibility and slow to deploy/manage.

Q5 ❌ Close, needs refinement

Hint: For predictable workloads with some flexibility in size/region:

Reserved Instances lock you into specific families/regions, offering large discounts but less flexible.

Savings Plans give similar savings but apply across instance sizes, families, and regions depending on the plan.

The “most cost-effective with flexibility” answer: Savings Plan (not Reserved Instance).

⚡ Score recap for this round:

✅ Correct: Q1, Q3, Q4

❌ Wrong/needs retry: Q2, Q5

You’re getting really close! The tricky part now is precision: knowing exactly what makes each option different in cost/flexibility.

If you want, we can do one final mini round just on Q2 and Q5 until you nail them cold. That way, you’re fully prepped for the lab.

Do you want to do that?

You said:
lets go!
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — one last mini round, just Q2 and Q5, no distractions. Let’s lock this in.

🔹 Mini Round

Q2. Capacity Reservations limitation (Short Answer)
Hint: Think what you pay for vs what you actually use. Keep it short and precise.

Q5. Pricing for predictable workload with flexibility (Short Answer)
Hint: You want cost savings like RIs but flexible across instance sizes or regions. Name the option.

Give it your best shot — we’ll check and confirm mastery!

You said:
q2) You are charged for on demand pricing even if you don;t use it(I have read you answer 3-4 times idk why its not sticking man I really need to read this section again and get it in) 
q5) Saving plans
ChatGPT said:

Boom — nailed it this time! 🎯

✅ Answers

Q2 — Capacity Reservations limitation

Correct: You are charged at On-Demand rates whether you use the reserved capacity or not.

Don’t worry if it wasn’t sticking before — this is one of those subtle differences that takes a few passes to really cement. A quick skim of the AWS docs before lab 1 will make it click fully.

Q5 — Predictable workload with flexibility

Correct: Savings Plans give you cost savings and flexibility across instance sizes and regions (unlike Reserved Instances which are less flexible).

💡 Reflection / Tip:

Concepts like Capacity Reservations vs RIs/Savings Plans are all about the subtle trade-offs: cost vs flexibility vs guarantee. Repetition + hands-on usage in your lab will cement them.

For these kinds of tricky sections, try writing a tiny comparison table before labs:

Option	Cost	Flexibility	Guarantee	Notes
On-Demand	Pay per use	High	None	Good for unpredictable workloads
Reserved Instance	Lower	Low	Yes	Predictable workload
Savings Plan	Lower	Medium-High	No	Flexible across families/regions
Capacity Reservation	On-Demand	Low	Yes	Guaranteed capacity, pay even if unused
