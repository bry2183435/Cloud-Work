# AWS Lab 1: Concept Review & Quiz Practice

## Date:
2025-09-29

## Topics Covered:
- EC2 Pricing Models: On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Savings Plans
- Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances
- Capacity Reservations
- Shared Responsibility Model
- Instance Families: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized
- On-Premises vs Cloud

---

## Quiz Practice Summary

### Strengths (Mastered Areas)
- **Pricing Model Recognition:** Correctly identified On-Demand, Spot, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans in multiple contexts.  
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** Consistently understood that the customer manages security *in the cloud*, while AWS manages security *of the cloud*.  
- **AWS Interaction Methods:** Correctly recalled AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK.  
- **Instance Families:** After retries, identified Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, and Storage Optimized correctly.

### Weaknesses (Needs Reinforcement)
- **Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances:** Needed hints to recall subtle difference — Host = full server control, Instance = isolation only.  
- **Capacity Reservations:** Took multiple retries to remember: **charged at On-Demand rates even if not used**.  
- **Savings Plans Coverage:** Missed that Amazon RDS is *not covered*.  
- **On-Premises Challenges:** Initially answered vaguely (“costs/resources”) — key points: **inflexibility** and **slow deployment/management**.  
- **Pricing for predictable workloads with flexibility:** Confused Reserved Instances vs Savings Plans; correct answer: **Savings Plans** for flexible, predictable workloads.

## Study Recommendations
1. **Re-read:**
   - Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances section.
   - Capacity Reservations vs Reserved Instances vs Savings Plans.
   - On-Premises vs Cloud benefits (focus on time and flexibility, not just cost).
   - AWS Savings Plans coverage (note exclusions like Amazon RDS).

2. **Active Recall Practice:**
   - Create a **mini flash sheet** of key differences for Hosts vs Instances, RIs vs Savings Plans, and Capacity Reservations.
   - Quiz yourself cold on those before labs.

3. **Hands-On Application:**
   - Use lab 1 to reinforce these concepts:
     - Launch different instance types.
     - Experiment with On-Demand vs Spot vs RIs.
     - Observe billing and instance behaviors.

## Reflection
- Cold quizzes revealed true retention; retries helped reinforce weak areas.  
- Strengths are solid in **basic EC2 concepts, instance types, and shared responsibility**.  
- Weaknesses are mostly **subtle distinctions in pricing options and control levels**, which will solidify with **hands-on labs and repeated review**.  
- Documenting this process helps track growth and will serve as a **reference for future labs and projects**.
