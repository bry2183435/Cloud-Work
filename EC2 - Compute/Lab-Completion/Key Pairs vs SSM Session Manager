Goal

Practice secure EC2 instance access and centralized management using SSH key pairs and AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager.

1. Instances Launched
Instance Type	Instance ID	Key Pair / IAM Role	Security Group
Key Pair (SSH)	i-XXXXXXX	my-key.pem	Port 22 open
SSM-managed	i-YYYYYYY	SSM_EC2_Role (AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore)	All ports closed

2. Access Verification
SSH Key Login (Key Pair Instance)

Command used:

ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-XXXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com


Verification:

whoami

SSM Session Manager Login (SSM Instance)

Steps:

Go to EC2 → Instances → Connect → Session Manager → Connect.

Run:

whoami

CloudTrail Logging Verification

Steps:

Open CloudTrail → Event history.

Filter by Event name = StartSession or by Resource ID = i-YYYYYYY.

Confirm event shows:

Event source: ssm.amazonaws.com

Target instance ID matches your SSM instance

3. Security Notes
Instance Type	Ports	IAM Role / Policy
Key Pair (SSH)	Port 22 open	None
SSM-managed	All ports closed	AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

4. Reflection / Lessons Learned

Key Pair (SSH) provides direct access but opens port 22 → more exposed to attacks.

SSM Session Manager requires no SSH keys and no open ports → reduces attack surface.

CloudTrail logs SSM activity centrally, which is better for auditing and compliance.

IAM roles with least privilege make managing access simpler and safer.

Centralized session management (SSM + CloudTrail + CloudWatch) is recommended for production environments.
