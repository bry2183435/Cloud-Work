Lab 1 â€“ EC2 Web Server Setup (Troubleshooting Journey)

Objective: Launch an EC2 instance, install/configure Apache, and verify web server accessibility.

Steps Taken & Issues Encountered:

EC2 Instance Launch

Started a t2.micro instance with Amazon Linux 2.

Configured security group to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

Apache Installation & Service Start

Connected via SSH and ran:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd


Verified service status with:

systemctl status httpd


Document Root Configuration

Created/edited index.html in /var/www/html/:

echo "Hello from EC2 Web Server" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html


Troubleshooting Connectivity

Encountered a connection refused when accessing the public IP.

Checked multiple areas:

Apache logs (/var/log/httpd/error_log).

Firewall/security group (confirmed HTTP open).

Verified Apache was running on port 80:

sudo lsof -i :80


Restarted Apache and re-tested connectivity.

Environment Factors

Delays were partly due to a slow local machine (4GB RAM) and unstable WiFi, which caused page reloads and SSH drops.

Resolution Path:

Confirmed Apache is installed and running.

Verified security group allowed HTTP traffic.

Rechecked that index.html existed in the correct path.

Repeatedly reboot or restart until the connection stabilizes.
